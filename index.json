[{"categories":["Basic"],"contents":"Introduction Setting up PFSense as a VPS within your home environment will provide several benefits. First, all your home network traffic will be protected by a well developed and capable next generation firewall. PFSense has been around since 2006 and has continued to grow in support and development making it an extremely advanced open source security solution. Although I will not go into it within this post, PFSense has a package manager that can be used to install additional tools like Snort, Suricata, pfBlocker, Squid and more. Second, it will allow you to access your home network from anywhere in the world. This will allow you to reach any home file servers and remote control systems via RDP or SSH. Finally, you can configure the VPN to route all traffic through the PFSense firewall, so all your connections from across the world can be secured by your home firewall and any packages you have installed. All of this for no montly cost as everything in this guide is either open source or a free service.\nRequirements PFSense Firewall - I am using this for my setup as AES-NI is recommended and the specs are adequate for my purposes ISP that gives you a public IP address (static OR dynamic) and doesn’t mind you port forwarding WiFi Access Point to give devices connectivity Familiarity with networking and installing an operating system to a device Set Up a Dynamic DNS Account This is only for those that do not pay for a static public IP address. If you are unsure, you likely have a dynamic address. I will be using FreeDNS as it is simple to configure for this purpose and free. After making your account, create a subdomain A record.\nThen, go to Dynamic DNS in the menu. Copy the “Direct URL” for your A record. You will see something like https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?YOUR_CODE_HERE. Copy only your code and save it for later.\nInstalling PFSense First thing you will need to do is install PFSense onto whatever Firewall you will be using. As this is pretty dependent on the Firewall you have chosen I will not go into great detail but use the downloads provided here. Once you have PFSense installed onto the Firewall, connect to the console port to access the PFSense CLI configuration menu.\nGo through the initial steps of assigning the interfaces for LAN and WAN (option 1), and setting up interface IP addresses (option 2). It is important to either assign yourself a static IP address in the WAN subnet, or setup a DHCP reservation on your modem. This will allow port forwarding to work properly. Once these are configured, you will be able to access the web GUI through the LAN IP address which will prompt you with a login as seen below.\nLogin with the default credentials (user:admin password:pfsense) to begin setting up the firewall.\nConnect Your Dynamic DNS Server Within PFSense, go to Services -\u0026gt; Dynamic DNS and select Add under Dynamic DNS Clients. If you are using a different Dynamic DNS provider than FreeDNS, look up how to add your dynamic DNS into PFSense. For freeDNS, select “freeDNS” as an option in the service type dropdown menu. Use WAN as the interface and type the full hostname into the hostname parameter. See below for an example:\nUse the token from earlier steps creating the freeDNS account and enter it into the password and confirm password parameters. Then save and you should now see your hostname in the Dynamic DNS configuration page with your IP address in green showing it has been updated.\nCreate Your VPS To begin setup, go to VPN -\u0026gt; OpenVPN -\u0026gt; Wizards and go through the wizard creating a VPS for Local User Access. The wizard takes you through the main steps, configuring a Certificate Authority (CA), create a Server Certificate using that CA, then configure OpenVPN Server information. When configuring OpenVPN Server information, you will need to select a port/protocol, create a tunnel network, and specify the local network subnet. You may also need to modify the NCP algorithms to support connecting devices.\nFor example, you may want all VPN users to have an address 172.16.0.0/24 and allow them access to your home network at 10.0.1.0/24. Select “Redirect Gateway” if you want to force all traffic through the VPN, this will enforce any firewall/IPS protection to your remote devices. Additionally, you may want to enable Dynamic IP to help keep clients connected while they are on the move.\nIn the last step, select both options to create firewall rules that allow your VPN to operate properly.\nCreate Users To create users, go to System -\u0026gt; User Manager and click add. Enter information for that user and select the Certificate checkbox. Use the VPN certificate authority to generate a client certificate. This will allow the user to connect to the VPN. Repeat to create all the users you would like to have access to the VPN.\nExport Client Configurations Go to System -\u0026gt; Package Manager -\u0026gt; Available Packages and install openvpn-client-export. When the install finishes, go to VPN -\u0026gt; OpenVPN and you should see a new submenu labeled Client Export. Select the VPN configured previously for Remote Access Server, and the Dynamic DNS hostname. Additionally, you will want to check Use Random Local Port to ensure multiple clients can run at the same time. Save these settings so they will be used for all future client exports. ![]\nScrolling to the bottom will show all the users configured for that VPN as well as options to export a config file for various platforms/operating systems. !\nDownload these configurations and send them to the people you want to connect, as well as their username and password configured earlier.\nPort Forward To allow VPN traffic to the PFSense Firewall, port forwarding is required on the modem. By default, OpenVPN uses UDP 1194; however, some ISPs may restrict the ports you are actually allowed to forward. If this is the case, TCP 443 is usually allowed as it is the port HTTPS uses.\nGo to your modem configuration page and setup port forwarding. Point the server IP to your PFSense WAN IP address and the TCP or UDP port chosen. Here is an example configuration on a Comcast modem.\nConnect Remotely Download the OpenVPN app on whatever device you use and import your configuration file. That’s it! You can now connect from anywhere in the world back to your home network. This setup can continue to be improved by taking advantage of other PFSense features like Snort, Squid, pfBlocker and others. I highly recommend you attempt to take full advantage of what PFSense has to offer by configuring strict firewall rules and utilizing the more advanced packages.\n","date":"June 8, 2020","hero":"/posts/projects/pfsensevpn/images/vpn.jpg","permalink":"https://nathanjmay.com:1313/posts/projects/pfsensevpn/","summary":"Introduction Setting up PFSense as a VPS within your home environment will provide several benefits.

Meterpreter is an extremely powerful payload which provides an attacker an advanced shell to interact with their target. It can run normal system commands, launch programs, keylog, screenshare, upload files, and many more powerful functions.\nHow to get a Meterpreter shell on a system? Many backdoors like Mosquito and Shamoon-2 are preconfigured with Meterpreter as a payload. It was originally created as a Metasploit Payload, so if you can find a system with an exploitable vulnerability just set the payload to a Meterpreter shell. Or, if you already have access to a system, you can generate a payload file using msfvenom to upload and run creating the shell. To demonstrate ways to get a Meterpreter shell and the commands it offers, I have configured the following test environment.\nUsing Meterpreter as a Metasploit payload: In my example environment, I have an attacker box (Kali VM), and a victim box (Windows 7 VM). A fresh install of Windows 7 is by default vulnerable to ms17_010, or EternalBlue. EternalBlue is what I will be using to break in to my target box, but the same is true for whatever vulnerability you plan to exploit as long as it gives you the ability to drop a payload onto the system. Once you have found whatever exploit you want to use against your target system, use the set payload command to choose the meterpreter backdoor that best fits your needs. In my case, I will be using Windows x64 reverse TCP to create a reverse shell back to my host system. Because it is a reverse shell, I need to specify which IP address for the connection to call back to. Using the set rhost command, I entered in the IP address of the attacker device (Kali VM).\nOnce you have all the Metasploit options configured, run exploit and if your exploit works correctly you should receive a Meterpreter shell on the last line as you can see below. Later, I will explain some of the powerful features Meterpreter has to offer.\nUsing msfvenom to generate a meterpreter file for the target system: If you already have system access to the victim and want to spawn a Meterpreter shell, an easy way to do that is generate a Meterpreter file using Msfvenom. Msfvenom allows users to output Metasploit payloads into files for different operating systems. In this case, we will be choosing windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp as the payload, my Kali VM’s IP address as the IP to make a connection to, port 3389, and the file type exe which is all then dropped into shell.exe.\nOnce you drop this file onto the target host and run it, open up a listener on your attacker device. To do this, use the metasploit listener with the command use multi/handler then configure the options specific to your environment. As you can see on the last line, we have a meterpreter shell once again.\nI have a Meterpreter shell… now what? As an attacker, Meterpreter offers some extremely valuable tools. Many of the basic commands are just aliases of common linux/windows commands. So for example, view contents of your current directory, you can use EITHER ls or dir, changed directories with cd, viewing your current directory with pwd, all very familiar commands.\nIf you want the environment to become even more familiar, simply execute the shell command and you will drop into the system shell.\nNow its time for some more exciting commands.\nSessions If you are controlling multiple systems, or just have multiple connections to one host, you can put your current connection to the background and interact with another session. In your current session, type bg or background and you will return to the multi/handler tool. Typing session will show all current connections to your system currently available and each will have a number. To pickup and interact with a session, type session -i (session #). Here is an example with many connections from the target system:\nHere is an example of a time I had many connections from many targets I was attacking:\nMigrate Processes: One of my favorite Meterpreter features is the ability to migrate the process to any other processes running on the system. This is useful because if someone is actively trying to defend/kill your Meterpreter process, you can move to a process like services.exe which is both not a suspicious process, but also critical to the system functioning normally.\nFor example, without further obfuscation a default Meterpreter payload running on the system looks like this in Task Manager:\nBy stopping that service, our connection would be closed. To avoid this, you can migrate to another service. In this example, I will migrate to explorer.exe which is the process Windows uses for the Users GUI.\nTo do this, use ps -a to view all processes running on that system. Take note of the authority the process has as we want to maintain running in a process with system authority.\nSelect an appropriate process for your needs, and migrate to that process using migrate (PID number of your process).\nNow, the Meterpreter shell is using a normal system process which cannot easily be seen. Here, we are running as explorer.exe:\nScreenshare: Self explanatory, but Meterpreter allows for screensharing using a Web GUI. This can easily be activated using the screenshare command.\nOn the left is the Kali VM viewing the Windows 7 system (right) through a web browser:\nKeylogging: To keylog a system, you first need to migrate to the process which is receiving the users keystrokes. This is usually one of two processes.\nexplorer.exe - user interface with desktop and other applications, used to keylog most user interaction\nwinlogon.exe - windows logon screen, used to capture logon credentials\nMigrate to the process you want to keylog, then run keyscan start to begin logging user input. Once you want to collect the logged items, type keyscan dump and all the users keystrokes will be dumped to your screen. In this example, I will keylog the system while a user enters their banking credentials onto a web browser.\nAfter running keyscan_start, waiting for the user to enter credentials, then keyscan_dump, drops the credentials clearly in plaintext. If you prefer to save the keystrokes to a file automatically every 30 seconds in case the session gets interrupted or you may need to store/search the keystrokes, use `post/\nClear Event Viewer As a system administrator, logs are critical to identifying system compromise and anomalies. An attacker can easily wipe the Windows Event Viewer logs with a simple command.\nLogs before wiping:\nWiping the logs:\nLogs wiped on system:\nTransfer Files Using the upload command, you can upload a file from your attacker to the victim host. Using the download command you can download a file from the victim host to your attacker device.\nSyntax:\ndownload c:\\\\path\\to\\file.exe\nupload /path/on/attacker c:\\\\path\\on\\victim\nDump Account Hashes To crack other user accounts, the hashes of other user accounts can easily be viewed using the hashdump command.\nGet System Privileges If you migrate to a process that does not have system privileges, you can attempt to escalate back to that authority using getsystem.\nWebcam Control Perhaps one of the most invasive and scary features of Meterpreter is the ability to detect webcams on the target, and then capture pictures using the webcam. Unfortunately, the VM I am demonstrating on does not have any webcam configured; however, the commands are fairly self explanatory.\nPlant Persistence To ensure future access to the system, you can plant persistence on your current Meterpreter session. To do this, first background the session and take note of the session number. Then use exploit/widows/local/persistence and set the parameters to your session number, in this example 3, and the local port for the persistence to call back to. After running exploit persistence will be planted so that on system boot, a reverse shell will be initiated from the compromised system.\nTo pick up on this reverse shell, once again use multi/handler, with meterpreter as the payload, and the proper listening port. Once listening by running exploit, once the Windows system reboots a new session will be created between the attacker and the victim.\nOther resources Meterpreter is extremely powerful and there are many more commands than those I highlighted in this post. Here are some additional resources for ways to weaponize Meterpreter:\nMeterpreter Cheat Sheet\nOffensive Security Writeup\nPersistence Methods\n","date":"June 8, 2020","hero":"/posts/tools/meterpreter/images/Meterpreter.jpg","permalink":"https://nathanjmay.com:1313/posts/tools/meterpreter/","summary":"What is Meterpreter?

I feel it is a far more accurate reflection of knowledge and ability than the other CompTIA certifications I have taken like Security+. Although there is still a lot to learn that is not reflected on this test, it is a great start for anyone looking to get more of an understanding of Penetration Testing and common attack vectors. I took about a week to formally ‘study’; however, a lot of my hobbies include things like HackTheBox and CTF challenges so I definitely recommend a few months to study for anyone without an existing background. I ended up scoring an 806 after a week of intense studying and felt I had learned a lot from the whole process. Additionally, because the PenTest+ is rated as more difficult than the A+, Net+, and Security+ exams, passing the certification renewed the other three for me which were due to expire this fall. For those interested in taking the certification, I highly recommend it! Listed below are the primary resources that helped make me feel confident in my ability to pass the test. My biggest recommendation is to spend some times hands on to confidently be able to perform, identify, and remediate the attacks listed on the exam objectives.\nRecommended Study Resources: Jason Dion’s PenTest+ course on Udemy - I would recommend starting here. Great way to familiarize yourself with the content of the test; however, it will NOT be sufficient as the actual exam is far more technical than the course is\nSybex Practice Test - Good tests that gave me a pretty accurate measurement of my ability to pass the exam.

OpenCanary is the free open source version of Canary, a popular and advanced honeypot. OpenCanary takes a different approach to intrusion detection. Instead of monitoring network traffic for known malicious actions and signatures, OpenCanary is system meant to be attractive to attackers that will alert an administrator when an attack is detected.\nProblems With Typical IDS If you have ever run an IDS like Snort, Suricata, Palo Alto, or similar, you know they flag a lot of traffic and make a lot of noise. Without fine-tuning the IDS properly, any legitimate warnings will be drowned in a mass of false positives and non-critical alerts. But even if the IDS administrator properly configures the system to decrease the alerts, there are still ways attackers can bypass an IDS. An attacker may use an unrecognizable zero day exploit, obfuscate their code, already be physically located inside with direct LAN access or leverage authentic means of remote access like a VPN to get access to a network without an IDS flagging the traffic.\nOpenCanary’s Solution Thinking like an attacker, once they somehow manage to get a foothold into a network, they often attempt to pivot to other systems and gain as much control as possible. In many security breaches reviewed, the hackers had been active within the target’s network for weeks or longer laterally moving throughout the network. OpenCanary attempts to identify attackers that have managed to gain access by presenting itself as a target for the attacker. OpenCanary can host a variety of services like HTTP, SQL and FTP. When an attacker attempts to enumerate and exploit the OpenCanary services, notifications are sent to announce the intrusion attempt. Because of the level of interaction required to trigger an OpenCanary alert, false positives are extremely unlikely. Unless you happen to have an inquisitive tech savvy employee enumerating your network, alerts from the OpenCanary likely mean an attacker is actively within your network attempting to expand control.\nMy Lab Setup To try out OpenCanary, I am using Ubuntu 20.10 as my OpenCanary system and Kali 2020.3 as my “attacker”. Both of these systems are deployed using VirtualBox and configured within the same NAT network so they will have LAN communication.\nInstallation Steps Update and install Python \u0026amp; other dependencies\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-virtualenv sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libpcap0.8-dev Create a directory for OpenCanary and create a python virtual environment\nmkdir yourdirectory cd yourdirectory virtualenv env/ . env/bin/activate Install Python packages\npip install opencanary pip install scapy pip install pcapy pip install rdpy Create the config file\nopencanaryd --copyconfig nano /etc/opencanardy/opencanary.conf Here, you can select which services you want to enable by changing the entry to “true”.\nI recommend logging be set up using syslog using this configuration:\n\u0026#34;syslog-unix\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;logging.handlers.SysLogHandler\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;formatter\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;syslog_rfc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;localhost\u0026#34;, 514 ], I will be using SMTP logging because I do not have a syslog server setup in this virtual environment:\n\u0026#34;handlers\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;SMTP\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;class\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;logging.handlers.SMTPHandler\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mailhost\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;smtp.gmail.com\u0026#34;, 587], \u0026#34;fromaddr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;noreply@yourdomain.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;toaddrs\u0026#34; : [\u0026#34;youraddress@gmail.com\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;OpenCanary Alert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;credentials\u0026#34; : [\u0026#34;youraddress\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;abcdefghijklmnop\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;secure\u0026#34; : [] } } } } Once everything is configured as you want, use\nopencanaryd --start to start the service. You should soon receive an alert stating OpenCanary is running and a notification for each service started.\nSimulating an attacker enumerating a device, I scanned the host and then tried to login to the discovered service:\nAs expected, I soon received an email notifying me of both the nmap scan and the failed login attempt:\nI then spent some time testing different enumeration/exploitation methods to see if OpenCanary would detect it and was impressed with the accuracy of alerts as well as the details within the alerts. Even if an attacker manages to take control of the OpenCanary device, OpenCanary will be able to send a few warning alerts before it is compromised.\nReview Things I like Lots of service options to choose from Variety of logging options Low false-positive rate Free way to detect threats when they matter most Things I don’t like You may need to create a new email to send alerts from Email credentials stored in plain-text in configuration file Setup is not super intuitive \u0026amp; you may need to engineer your own way to automate startup Configuration Tips Avoid the services that may be recognized as OpenCanary (for example, the HTTP DiskStation login may be a give away if the attacker is familiar with OpenCanary) Avoid services with conflicting Operating System identifiers Fewer services will generate fewer alerts, try sticking to one or two and always monitor the alerts Enabling scan detection will likely generate too much traffic to be taken seriously (most scans will already generate logs because of the fingerprinting methods used) ","date":"June 8, 2020","hero":"/posts/tools/opencanary/images/canary.jpg","permalink":"https://nathanjmay.com:1313/posts/tools/opencanary/","summary":"What is OpenCanary?
