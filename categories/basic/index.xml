      <description>Introduction Setting up PFSense as a VPS within your home environment will provide several benefits. First, all your home network traffic will be protected by a well developed and capable next generation firewall. PFSense has been around since 2006 and has continued to grow in support and development making it an extremely advanced open source security solution. Although I will not go into it within this post, PFSense has a package manager that can be used to install additional tools like Snort, Suricata, pfBlocker, Squid and more.</description>

      <description>What is Meterpreter? Meterpreter is an extremely powerful payload which provides an attacker an advanced shell to interact with their target. It can run normal system commands, launch programs, keylog, screenshare, upload files, and many more powerful functions.
How to get a Meterpreter shell on a system? Many backdoors like Mosquito and Shamoon-2 are preconfigured with Meterpreter as a payload. It was originally created as a Metasploit Payload, so if you can find a system with an exploitable vulnerability just set the payload to a Meterpreter shell.</description>

      <title>My PenTest&#43; Experience</title>
      <link>https://nathanjmay.com:1313/posts/resources/pentest/</link>

      <description>About the PenTest+ Exam: The PenTest+ is among the more intermediate certifications offered by CompTIA and focuses primarily on penetration testing techniques and methodology. The exam has both practical hands on questions as well as traditional multiple choice questions to test both the knowledge and capability of testers.
It is broken up into 5 primary sections
Planning and Scoping - 15% Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning - 22% Attacks and Exploits - 30% Penetration Testing Tools - 17% Reporting and Communication - 16% For a quick comparison to other offensive side cyber certifications, it is generally regarded as being more difficult and hands on than the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), and less difficult/hands on than the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT).</description>

      <description>What is OpenCanary? OpenCanary is the free open source version of Canary, a popular and advanced honeypot. OpenCanary takes a different approach to intrusion detection. Instead of monitoring network traffic for known malicious actions and signatures, OpenCanary is system meant to be attractive to attackers that will alert an administrator when an attack is detected.
Problems With Typical IDS If you have ever run an IDS like Snort, Suricata, Palo Alto, or similar, you know they flag a lot of traffic and make a lot of noise.</description>
